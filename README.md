# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System using Machine Learning

> This project aims to identify plant diseases from leaf images using machine learning models. Built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, the dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and includes thousands of labeled images of diseased and healthy plants. The goal is to support farmers and researchers by providing an early and accurate diagnosis system.

## 🌾 Dataset

- 📦 Source: [Kaggle Plant Village Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- 🔢 Total Images: ~50,000+
- 🍂 Categories: Healthy and various diseased leaves (Tomato, Potato, Apple, Grape, etc.)
- 📁 Format: `.jpg` images organized by label folders

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Load and visualize dataset
2. Preprocess images (resize, normalize)
3. Split into training/testing sets
4. Train ML models:
   - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
   - SVM
   - Random Forest
5. Evaluate accuracy using metrics
6. Predict disease from sample leaf image

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- CNN Accuracy: ~97% on test data
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report used
- Comparisons made between different algorithms

*(Actual results may vary based on training setup and hardware)*
